# React Form Submission App

This is a simple web page built using React that contains a form with **Name**, **Email**, and **Message** fields. When the user submits the form, a success message is displayed without refreshing the page. This app demonstrates basic form handling in React using hooks and form validation.

## Features

- A form with the following fields: **Name**, **Email**, and **Message**.
- Validation to ensure all fields are filled out before submission.
- Success message displayed dynamically without page reload (using JavaScript and React's `useState`).
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the form.
- **CSS3**: Styling for form and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Form submission logic and dynamic handling.
